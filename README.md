# syah
A Django site for the band See You At Home, hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The site is fairly over-engineered for what it is,
but it was useful as a learning exercise.

Currently consulting the band on domain and styling. WIP build is available [here](http://syah-dev.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
